\fs22 (MailTags  Mail Plugin)
\fs26  \

\fs22 THIS IS A LEGAL AGREEMENT between you (either an individual or an entity) and Indev Software, Inc. ("Indev").  By installing the software, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this License Agreement.  If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, do not install the software. \
1. Grant of Limited License.
\fs26  \

\fs22 Indev grants to you the non-exclusive, personal liciense to use Indev software program, MailTags  (the "Software"). \
2. Copyright.
\fs26  \

\fs22 The Software is owned by Indev and is protected by Canadian copyright laws and by international treaty provisions.  You should therefore treat the Software like any other copyrighted material (such as for example, books or musical recordings).  Among other things, copyright laws prohibit you from making derivative works of the Software.  You may, however, make copies of the Software, provided that you not friggin' copy the Registration Key (see Section 3(a) below).
\fs26  \

\fs22 3. Other Restrictions.
\fs26  \

\fs22 (a) You may register your copy of the Software by purchasing a Registration Code at http://store.indev.ca.  The Registration Code will enable full usage of the  Software beyond the trial period.  You may not copy the Registration Code except for archival purposes. \
(b) You may use your registered copy of the software on multiple computers only in conjunction with your own user and email configurations.  \
(c) You may modify, reverse-engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software.  However, you may not do so for the purpose of disabling the feature of the Software that enforces the trial period of your copy of the Software (i.e. circumventing the Registration Key system) or for the purpose of circumventing any of the terms of this License Agreement or any other provision of law. \
(c) You may not claim that the Software is yours, and you may not use the name Indev to endorse or promote products derived from the Software without prior written permission. \
(d) You must use the Software at all times in a manner that is consistent with the software licenses granted to you by other companies that have provided software for your computer.  For example, MailTags is designed to be used with the Mac OS X operating system, and so you may not use MailTags in a manner inconsistent with the Mac OS X license agreement between you and Apple Computer, Inc.

\fs22 THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.
