\fs24 \cf0 MailTags 3 Preview 1 is provided as an early preview so that MailTags users can migrate to OS X 10.7 and continue to use their tag workflows\
MailTags Preview 1 is not a final product and should not be considered a full release but it should be sufficient for most users to employ MailTags on Lion for the next few weeks.
